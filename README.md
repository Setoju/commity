# Commiti

AI-powered commit message and pull request description generator for Git repositories, using Google AI models.

## What It Does

Commiti helps you:

- Generate conventional commit messages from staged changes.
- Generate structured pull request descriptions from branch diffs.
- Review and optionally edit generated commit messages before writing to Git history.
- Open a prefilled PR/MR page in your browser for GitHub, GitLab, or GitBucket (no provider API token required).
- Preserve semantic diff quality on large changes using file-aware clipping that keeps file headers and hunk markers.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.2+
- Git
- Google AI API key
- A Git repository as your working directory

## Install Dependencies (from source)

```bash
bundle install
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/commiti [options]
```

Or after gem installation:

```bash
commiti [options]
```

## Configuration

Commiti uses a single configuration approach: environment variables.

Set variables in your shell, CI secret manager, or local `.env` file (in your project):

```dotenv
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key

# Optional overrides:
# COMMITI_MODEL=gemma-4-31b-it
# COMMITI_CANDIDATES=1
# COMMITI_BASE_BRANCH=main
# COMMITI_NO_COPY=false
# COMMITI_AUTO_SPLIT=false
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` is also accepted as an alias for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

You can copy `.env.example` as a starting point.

Your API key is sent directly from your local process to Google's API.
Commiti does not store it and does not proxy requests through any Commiti server.
Never commit `.env` to git.

### Options

- `--type TYPE` where `TYPE` is `commit` or `pr` (default: `commit`)
- `--base BRANCH` base branch for PR diff (default: `main`)
- `--no-copy` print output only, skip clipboard copy
- `--candidates N` generate `N` output candidates (`1`-`5`, default: `1`)
- `--auto-split` auto-group staged changes into multiple connected commits (commit flow only)
- `-h`, `--help` show help

## Commit Flow (`--type commit`)

By default, Commiti creates a single commit from staged changes.
Use `--auto-split` to let Commiti group connected file changes into multiple atomic commits.

1. Shows `git status --short`.
2. Asks for confirmation before staging (`git add -A`).
3. Ensures there are staged changes.
4. Reads staged diff and generates commit message candidate(s).
   - If the AI draft misses a conventional commit prefix, Commiti auto-normalizes it to a valid conventional subject.
5. If `--candidates` is greater than `1`, shows numbered candidates and asks you to select one.
6. Shows selected message and asks: `Commit with this message? [y/e/N]`
   - `y`: commit now
   - `e`: open editor, then validate and re-confirm
   - `N`: skip commit
7. Writes commit with `git commit --file <tempfile>`.

### Commit Message Validation

- First line must use a conventional commit prefix (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`).
- First line must be 100 characters or fewer.

### Why `--file` instead of `-m`

Multi-line messages and special characters are safer with `git commit --file`, avoiding shell quoting edge cases.

### Editor Selection

Commit edit mode uses:

1. `VISUAL`
2. `EDITOR`
3. Fallback: `notepad` on Windows, `vi` on non-Windows

## PR Flow (`--type pr`)

1. Reads branch diff: `git diff <base>...HEAD`.
2. Generates PR description with these sections:
   - `## Summary`
   - `## Motivation`
   - `## Changes Made`
   - `## Testing Notes`
3. Builds provider compare/MR URL with prefilled title/body using query params.
  - GitHub/GitBucket: compare URL
  - GitLab: new merge request URL
   - If the URL would exceed safe browser/provider limits, Commiti drops description prefill automatically and keeps the shortest usable URL.
4. Asks before opening browser.

The tool opens a browser URL only. It does not call provider APIs.

### Diff Context Protocol

When a diff exceeds internal size limits, Commiti clips and summarizes using file-aware rules:

- Keeps full `diff --git` file headers where possible.
- Preserves `@@ ... @@` hunk headers before clipping hunk bodies.
- Includes as many complete files/hunks as fit in the limit, then appends a clipping notice.
- Summarizes large chunks asynchronously and in batches to reduce total LLM round trips.
- Falls back to deterministic file-level summaries if model summarization times out.

This improves semantic quality for AI generation compared with naive truncation.

## Examples

Generate commit message and commit interactively:

```bash
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/commiti --type commit
```

Generate multiple commit message candidates and pick one:

```bash
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/commiti --type commit --candidates 3
```

Generate PR description against `develop`:

```bash
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/commiti --type pr --base develop
```

Print only, do not copy to clipboard:

```bash
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/commiti --type pr --no-copy
```

## Implementation Overview

Main entrypoint and flow orchestration:

- `bin/commiti`: CLI parsing and flow dispatch
- `lib/flows/base_flow.rb`: shared generation pipeline and quality checks
- `lib/flows/commit_flow.rb`: commit-specific staging/edit/commit interactions
- `lib/flows/pr_flow.rb`: PR-specific URL generation/open flow

Core services:

- `lib/services/git_reader.rb`
  - `lib/services/git/git_reader.rb`: Reads staged diff and branch diff, applies file-aware clipping, provides recent commits helper.
  - `lib/services/git/git_writer.rb`: Reads status/staged state, stages (`git add -A`), commits with message file (`git commit --file`), reads branch and origin remote.
  - `lib/services/git/diff_parser.rb`: Parses diff blocks and derives change metadata.
  - `lib/services/git/pr/pr_opener.rb`: Parses GitHub/GitLab/GitBucket remotes, builds provider-specific PR/MR URL, opens browser cross-platform.
- `lib/services/google_client.rb`: Sends generation requests to Google Generative Language API.
- `lib/services/diff_summarization/diff_summarizer.rb`: Orchestrates large-diff summarization and summary combine.
  - `lib/services/diff_summarization/batch_runner.rb`: Runs asynchronous, batched per-file summarization jobs.
  - `lib/services/diff_summarization/fallback_builder.rb`: Builds deterministic summaries when model summarization fails or times out.
- `lib/services/helpers/config_loader.rb`: Loads configuration from environment variables.
  - `lib/services/helpers/prompt_builder.rb`: Builds strict system/user prompts for commit and PR modes.
  - `lib/services/helpers/interactive_prompt.rb`: Handles confirmation prompts, candidate selection, editor loop, and commit message validation.
  - `lib/services/helpers/clipboard.rb`: Provides cross-platform clipboard support.
  - `lib/services/helpers/spinner.rb`: Displays a spinner for long-running operations.
- `lib/services/message_generator.rb`: Generates commit and PR messages with quality checks.
- `lib/services/message_presenter.rb`: Presents generated messages to the user.
- `lib/services/flow_context_builder.rb`: Builds the context for different Commiti flows.
- `lib/services/git/commit/commit_staging.rb`: Handles staging changes for a commit.
- `lib/services/git/commit/commit_execution.rb`: Executes the git commit command.

Service loading:

- `lib/commiti.rb` requires all service modules.

## Error Handling

The CLI reports user-friendly errors for common cases such as:

- No changes/staged changes
- Invalid or missing Git data
- Google AI API connectivity/authentication failures
- Summarization timeouts on large diffs (automatically falls back to a deterministic summary and continues)
- Browser open failures

## Notes

- The default model is `gemma-4-31b-it` in `GoogleClient`.
- PR browser URL body payloads are URL-encoded with `URI.encode_www_form`.
- You can tune summarization worker concurrency with `DIFF_SUMMARY_WORKERS`.
